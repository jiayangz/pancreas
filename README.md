# Image Processing Techniques for Pancreatic Abnormality Detection on Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Proof of Concept
## Background
Detection of pancreatic abnormalities—including cysts, calcifications, and ductal changes—is important for appropriate diagnosis and subsequent clinical management. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides high-resolution visualization of pancreatic tissue, making it an invaluable tool for identifying these anomalies. However, manual interpretation of pancreatic MRI scans is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Image processing methods (both unsupervised machine learning and traditional filters) have the potential to automate the detection and characterization of these abnormalities, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Integrating image processing techniques into MRI analysis could aid radiologists in early detection and risk stratification, ultimately leading to better patient management and outcomes. In this work, we provide a proof of concept that methods such as image filtering and unsupervised machine learning can automatically identify abnormalities on pancreatic MRIs such as cysts, calcifications, and ductal dilatation.

## Method
To identify larger abnormalities such as cysts and calcifications in pancreatic MRI scans, we employed a contrastive learning framework using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The CNN was trained to maximize similarity within groups and differentiate between them; this approach clustered voxels in the MRI images into distinct groups using dimensionality reduction with uniform manifold approximation and projection and k-means clustering (N=3) to identify different structures. For identifying ductal structures, we applied the Frangi vesselness filter to enhance duct-like features in the images. We then extracted the longest connected components to isolate the main pancreatic duct. These methods were applied to a recent public MRI dataset to assess their effectiveness in identifying pancreatic abnormalities.

## Results
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods with representative images. In Figure 1, where the contrastive learning framework successfully detects pancreatic cysts and calcifications within MRI images, distinguishing them from normal pancreatic tissue. Figure 2 illustrates that the application of the Frangi vesselness filter enhances the visibility of the pancreatic duct, enabling its identification and extraction from the MRI scans.
